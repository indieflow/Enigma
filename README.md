Enigma
======

After seeing Andrew Lee's Prowler RC car design at www.utypedesign.com which he modelled from an existing RC car design
I decided to have a go myself after wanting to design and build an RC car from the ground up for years.
With the increase of 3D printers, this design and build process has finally become more easily achievable.
The Enigma will be based around the Vantage RC car hardware which I had lying around the house.
